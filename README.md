I gathered the data from https://fbref.com/en/ by finding a team, then copying and pasting their player data into a Google Sheet, cleaned up the ages manually, and exported it as a csv. I then imported it into RStudio and began making my graphs. I ran analyses on the distribution of ages for all the players on my 3 teams, then I made a scatterplot for the playtime in minutes versus the number of goals every player makes. I did look more specifically at Barbra Banda, so on the scatterplot, she is highlighted in pink and has a label.

How to reproduce: 
1. Download the 3 data sets
2. Make sure all 4 files are in the same folder
3. Import the 4 total files (3 data sets and the code files) into R studio
4. Confirm that all the names of files match the files in the folder, and your working directory is in the folder with all the files.
5. Run code!
